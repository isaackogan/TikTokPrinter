    [MANUALLY FIND PRINTER]

    Not keen on auto_find? Use the USBDeview, or auto_find, to determine your printer's vendor ID and product ID.
    If you include them as parameters in create_usb, TikTokPrinter will first try to connect using them
    before automatically finding your printer, so you don't have to pick each time.
    
    [INVALID ENDPOINT ADDRESS]
    
    Receiving an Invalid Endpoint error with a USB printer?

    Try adding â€œin_ep = 0x81, out_ep = 0x03" to the create_usb function!
    If you are not receiving this error, do not add the additional parameters!
    If you continue to receive this error, try doing out_ep = 0x02. 

    If that still doesn't work, make a ticket & we will handle it together!
